## Serverless Concepts
- `action` - a piece of code that performs one specific task that can be deployed to the Adobe I/O Runtime as source code or a Docker image. An action performs work when invoked via REST API. Actions can also automatically respond to events from the Adobe Cloud Platforms via a webhook and trigger.
- `trigger` - a statement that you want to react to a certain event and fired when one is received.
- `rule` - a rule associates a trigger with an action. Every time a trigger fires, the rule invokes the associated action.
- `composition` - informally named apps, run in the cloud using automatically managed compute and memory resources and have control over action invocation and data flow.
