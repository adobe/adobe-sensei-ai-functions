# Adobe Console Integration
-->

## Overview
The Adobe I/O Console provides the definitive destination for any developer looking to engage with and integrate Adobe cloud, mobile, and web technologies.

## Setup

1. Open your browser to the [Adobe I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io) and login with your pre-defined CC id and pw.

2. Ensure the **Integrations** tab is selected, then locate the integration by the name of `Sensei lab X` (where X is your assigned lab #) and click on it.

3. Once it's open, locate the **Default redirect URI** for your assigned user number and copy it. For instance, the one assigned to user **Sensei Lab 1** is outlined in red below:

   > **NOTE:** This URL will be different for each user so make sure you locate the one for your specific user number.

1. Open the URL copied from the **Default redirect URI** in the previous step to authorize your app to access your Creative Cloud files. When it is run the first time, you will receive a pop-up like below, where you should click on the **Allow Access** button. You will then be re-routed to the Adobe Creative Cloud site where you can login with the Creative Cloud userid/pw provided to you for the lab.

   > **NOTE:** Don't worry if you did not receive the pop-up, it may have been run already in a previous lab.

1. Once logged in, look for the **Creative Cloud Files** or **Files** link under **Assets** and click on it.

1. **IMPORTANT:** Before moving on, you must create your own personal folder to be used throughout this workshop. On the top right, click on the **Actions** arrow and choose **Create Folder** from the options. Name it `sensei-lab-x` where `x` is your assigned lab user number.
